# Personal-Website
This is the first draft of my personal website. It was created using HTML and CSS with one line JS code. 

The index.html is the homepage and has a headshot and quote that I like. The about.html page is some additional information about me. The portfolio.html page contains a link to my incomplete MeadTools project.

11/2/23 added contact page and made the site more responsive.
